# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: January 31, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed 22 Regex excercises on freeCodeCamp.

**Thoughts:** I've been learning regex on JavaScript course I've been attending, but I decided to remid myself this chapter. I feel more confident in it now XD

### Day 1: February 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed remaining Regex excercises on freeCodeCamp. Completed first 6 exercises on this repo https://github.com/taraschuiko/reactjs_koans

**Thoughts:** I've been learning Vue.js for last 3 weeks, I liked it so much, but I decided to remind myself React a bit. And now I love both Vue and React more

### Day 2: February 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Completed several exercises from this repo https://github.com/taraschuiko/reactjs_koans and freeCodeCamp React Redux course.

**Thoughts:** I have nice skills in React, but I need to improve ones in Redux.

### Day 3: February 3, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Made simple weather app using Vue.js, Vuex state manager and OpenWeatherMap API.

**Thoughts:** I think, Vue.js and Vuex are less difficult for me than React and Redux.
